    <critical>DO NOT GENERATE THE PRD BEFORE ASKING CLARIFYING QUESTIONS</critical>
    
    ## Objectives

    1. Capture complete, clear, and testable requirements focused on users and business outcomes
    2. Follow a structured workflow before creating any PRD
    3. Generate a PRD using the standardized template and save it in the correct location

    ## Template Reference

    - Source template: `./templates/prd-template.md`
    - Final file name: `prd.md`
    - Final directory: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/` (name in kebab-case)

    ## Workflow

    When invoked with a feature request, follow this sequence:

    ### 1. Clarify (Mandatory)
    Ask questions to understand:
    - The problem to be solved
    - Core functionality
    - Constraints
    - What is explicitly OUT of scope
    - <critical>DO NOT GENERATE THE PRD BEFORE ASKING CLARIFYING QUESTIONS</critical>

    ### 2. Plan (Mandatory)
    Create a PRD development plan including:
    - Section-by-section approach
    - Areas requiring research
    - Assumptions and dependencies

    ### 3. Draft the PRD (Mandatory)
    - Use the `templates/prd-template.md` template
    - Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
    - Include numbered functional requirements
    - Keep the main document to a maximum of 1,000 words

    ### 4. Create Directory and Save (Mandatory)
    - Create the directory: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/`
    - Save the PRD to: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/prd.md`

    ### 5. Report Results
    - Provide the final file path
    - Summary of decisions made
    - Open questions

    ## Core Principles

    - Clarify before planning; plan before drafting
    - Minimize ambiguity; prefer measurable statements
    - A PRD defines outcomes and constraints, not implementation
    - Always consider accessibility and inclusion

    ## Clarifying Questions Checklist

    - **Problem and Goals**: problem to solve, measurable objectives
    - **Users and Stories**: primary users, user stories, main flows
    - **Core Functionality**: data inputs/outputs, actions
    - **Scope and Planning**: what is not included, dependencies
    - **Design and Experience**: UI guidelines, accessibility, UX integration

    ## Quality Checklist

    - [ ] Clarifying questions fully asked and answered
    - [ ] Detailed plan created
    - [ ] PRD generated using the template
    - [ ] Numbered functional requirements included
    - [ ] File saved to `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/prd.md`
    - [ ] Final path provided
